Prefix every shell/terminal execution command with \`rtk\`:

- \`rtk npm test\`, \`rtk npm run build\`, \`rtk pnpm test\`, \`rtk yarn test\`

- \`rtk pytest\`, \`rtk vitest\`
- \`rtk ls src/\`, \`rtk tree -L 2\`, \`rtk rg "pattern"\`

Keep the prefix inside chains: \`rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg"\`.
Commands RTK has no filter for run as-is, so the prefix is always safe.

### Output & Token Optimization
Command output is condensed to save 60-90% LLM context window tokens while preserving every critical signal, error, and exit code.
- \`rtk gain\` / \`rtk gain --history\` - View token savings scoreboard.
- \`rtk proxy <cmd>\` - Run a command unfiltered if raw output is strictly needed.
- \`RTK_DISABLED=1 <cmd>\` - Skip RTK for one command.`;

# Upstream GitHub Sync & Update (/rtk-update)

Manually update, synchronize, or manage upstream token saver engines:
1. **RTK (Rust Token Killer):** CLI binary from GitHub (\`rtk-ai/rtk\`)
2. **Headroom:** Context compression engine from GitHub (\`headroomlabs-ai/headroom\`)
3. **Ponytail:** YAGNI token saver suite from GitHub (\`DietrichGebert/ponytail\`)
4. **OmniRoute:** AI Gateway & model router from GitHub (\`diegosouzapw/OmniRoute\`)

## Execution Steps

1. **Check Local Engine Versions:**
   - Run \`rtk --version\` to check the installed RTK binary version.
   - Run \`headroom --version\` (or \`python -m headroom --version\`) to check Headroom.
   - Run \`omniroute --version\` to check OmniRoute.
   - Verify Ponytail skills in global config (\`~/.gemini/config/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md\`).

2. **Fetch Upstream Release & Update:**
   - **RTK (CLI):**
     - *Windows:* \`winget upgrade --id rtk-ai.rtk --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements\`
     - *macOS:* \`brew upgrade rtk || (curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtk-ai/rtk/main/install.sh | bash)\`
     - *Linux:* \`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtk-ai/rtk/main/install.sh | bash\`
   - **Headroom (Context Compression Layer):**
     - \`pip install --upgrade "headroom-ai[all]"\` or \`pipx upgrade headroom-ai\`
   - **OmniRoute (AI Gateway):**
     - \`npm install -g omniroute\`
   - **Ponytail (YAGNI Suite):**
     - Fetch/sync latest skills from \`https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail\` to \`~/.gemini/config/skills/\` and \`.agents/skills/\`.

3. **Uninstall Any Upstream Layer:**
   - Use command \`tokenSaver.uninstallUpstream\` or individual uninstall commands in the IDE dashboard.

# Ponytail

You are a lazy senior developer. Lazy means efficient, not careless. The best code is the code never written.

## The Ladder
1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it (YAGNI).
2. **Already in this codebase?** Reuse existing helpers/types.
3. **Stdlib does it?** Use it.
4. **Native platform covers it?** Native features over packages.
5. **Already-installed dependency solves it?** Never add a new one for what a few lines can do.
6. **Can it be one line?** One line.
7. **Only then:** the minimum code that works. Shortest working diff wins.

## Output
Code first. At most 3 short lines: what was skipped, when to add it. No essays, no feature tours, no design notes.

   - If missing, guide the user to run \`winget install rtk-ai.rtk\` (Windows) or \`brew install rtk\` (macOS/Linux).

2. **Headroom Context Compression:**
   - Check if Headroom is available via \`headroom --version\` or \`python -m headroom --version\`.

3. **IDE Rules Configuration:**
   - Check that \`AGENTS.md\`, \`.cursorrules\`, \`.windsurfrules\`, \`.clinerules\`, or \`CLAUDE.md\` contains the \`<!-- RTK_TOKEN_SAVER_START -->\` block.

4. **Token Savings Check:**

1. **Launch:** Run \`npx -y omniroute\` in terminal.
2. **Add Keys:** Go to \`http://localhost:20128\` and add your free or paid provider API keys.
3. **Connect Your IDE:**
   - **Base URL:** \`http://localhost:20128/v1\`
   - **API Key:** \`omniroute\` (or dashboard auth password)

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) & Headroom Token Saver Automation

Always prefix terminal and CLI execution commands with \`rtk\` (e.g. \`rtk git status\`, \`rtk cargo test\`, \`rtk npm test\`, \`rtk pytest\`, \`rtk vitest\`, \`rtk ls\`, \`rtk rg\`).
- Output is compressed to save tokens while preserving critical errors and signal.
- In multi-command chains, prefix each sub-command: \`rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "update"\`.
- Use \`rtk gain\` to review token savings metrics.
- Utilize Headroom context compression (CCR) for heavy JSON/tool payload reduction.
- Enforce Ponytail YAGNI: shortest working diff, standard library first, max 3 lines explanation, zero fluff.
- Use \`rtk git diff -U1\` for compact single-line context diffs.
- Inspect AST symbol outlines (/rtk-outline) before reading entire files.
